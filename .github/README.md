# CI Setup - Perfect for Early Stage Development

Clean, focused CI with separate test jobs and proper artifacts.

## What You Have

### Main CI (`ci.yml`) - ~20 minutes total

**Runs on every push and PR to main/develop**

**Jobs run in parallel after build:**

1. **Code Quality** (~3 minutes)
   - Format checking (Prettier)
   - Linting (ESLint)
   - Type checking (TypeScript)

2. **Build** (~3 minutes)
   - Builds all packages
   - Caches build artifacts
   - Shared by all test jobs

3. **Unit Tests** (~5 minutes)
   - Fast, isolated tests
   - No external dependencies
   - Individual artifacts + coverage

4. **Integration Tests** (~8 minutes)
   - Database-dependent tests
   - PostgreSQL service
   - Individual artifacts + coverage

5. **E2E Tests** (~10 minutes)
   - Full application testing
   - Real database interactions
   - Individual artifacts + coverage

6. **Test Summary** (~1 minute)
   - Collects all test results
   - Posts summary to PR
   - Combined artifacts

### PR Checks (`pr.yml`) - ~3 minutes

**Fast feedback on pull requests**

- Quick format and lint checks
- No tests (main CI handles those)
- Super fast feedback loop

## Artifacts Available

**For Each Test Type:**

- ✅ **JUnit XML** - Machine-readable test results
- ✅ **HTML Reports** - Human-readable test reports
- ✅ **Coverage Reports** - Code coverage analysis
- ✅ **Test Summary** - Combined results overview

**Coverage Reporting:**

- ✅ **Codecov integration** with separate flags for each test type
- ✅ **Coverage trends** and PR diffs
- ✅ **Automatic uploads** from each test job

## Benefits

✅ **Organized** - Separate jobs for each test type  
✅ **Debuggable** - Individual artifacts per test type  
✅ **Parallel** - Tests run simultaneously after build  
✅ **Cached** - Build artifacts reused across test jobs  
✅ **Coverage** - Full Codecov integration with flags  
✅ **Fast feedback** - PR checks in 3 minutes  
✅ **Complete** - All test types covered with proper reporting

## Setup Required

Add this secret to your GitHub repository for coverage reporting:

```
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_codecov_token_here
```

## What This Gives You

- **Fast feedback** - Know immediately if code quality issues exist
- **Parallel testing** - All test types run simultaneously
- **Proper artifacts** - Download specific test results for debugging
- **Coverage tracking** - See coverage trends and PR impacts
- **PR summaries** - Automatic test result comments on PRs
- **Organized results** - Easy to find and debug specific test failures

Perfect balance of completeness and simplicity for early stage development!
